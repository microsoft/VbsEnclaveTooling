      <!-- 
        When the solution is in a clean state Microsoft.Windows.VbsEnclaveTooling.0.0.0 doesn't exist.
        This is a work around to allow the enclave projects to build for the first time as they rely
        on the generated code and the abi header files provided in the nuget package inorder to build. 
        
        On subsequent builds, the test enclave projects should get the new locally built version via
        the ToolingNuget project, when the AddLocalNuGetPackageBeforeBuild target in TestEnclaveAndHostAppShared.targets
        file is ran. 
        
        When we release officially this can be removed and the official package can be used by the test
        projects instead when the solution is in a clean state.
