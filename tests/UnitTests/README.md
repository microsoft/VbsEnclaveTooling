Running Tests in the repository
------------
The project uses MSTest as the testing framework. To run the tests
you can go to `Test` > `Test Explorer` and then run the test(s) you want
to run. Alternatively you can right click on the `.cpp` file you want to
test and select `Run Tests` or `Debug Tests`.
