# What is this for?
The content in the `<language>\` folders contain the latest code generated by
the `edlcodegen` executable. Whenever someone opens a pull request that changes the generated code, these
folders make it easy for reviewers to compare and see exactly what's changed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The content of the `Enclave` and `HostApp` folders should always show the current output of the `edlcodegen`
> executable.

## How to update
1. Make updates to the `CodeGenerationState.edl` file if needed.
1. Rebuild the `ToolingExecutable` project.
1. Add modified files in the `CurrentCodeGenerationState` directory to your pull request.

> [!NOTE]
> Add only files that the `edlcodegen` executable generates itself. The files generated by the `flatc` 
> executable are not needed (e.g `FlatbufferTypes.h`).
